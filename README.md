These things have worked well for us. We have twin boys, so some of our numbers are higher than normal.

## Strategies

### Keep all of the robots running all of the time.

It has been supremely important to run the laundry, dish washer, and Roomba regularly and often. You never want to fall behind; this way lies madness. Get used to kicking off a half-full dishwasher or washing machine. Check the robot states at least once a day; maybe twice.

### Trade nights.

You are adults. Adults need sleep. Babies need sleep also, but not the same way adults do. Instead of having both of you exhausted and fried from being up all night, trade nights: one adult sleeps with the babies and feeds/sooths/changes them at night, the other sleeps in their own bed with earplugs and an eyemask and sleeps as long as they can. This appears to be working for us; I don't know how long we will sustain it.

### Pragmatism is a good strategy.

This is probably because we have twins. We don't have time to deal with parental freakouts because they require food and changing and sleeping and soothing all the time. This is great; all of the concerns about nipple confusion and baby classical music and the other crazy stuff goes away. The kids are alright, just be a mammal.

## Tools

### [Halo Sleep Sack](http://www.halosleep.com)

These things are pretty great and not super fiddly. We have about 4 per baby in a couple of weights. The heavier weight is nice at night or if we go outside and it's windy.

### Hand me down clothing

Don't buy baby clothes; get them from friends who desperately want to get rid of them. Bonus: they are already stained, so you can stop worrying about keeping your baby impeccibly stylish and start worrying about keeping the robots running and taking naps.

### [Boon Lawn Countertop Drying Rack](http://smile.amazon.com/Boon-Lawn-Countertop-Drying-Green/dp/B004OR1DTC)

Great for bottle/breastpump part drying. Remember: lots of little fiddly parts.

### [Oxo Dishwasher Basket](http://www.oxo.com/p-1034-dishwasher-basket.aspx)

This is how you will wash your bottle nipples, breast pump parts, and other small things.

### Pampers

We're using disposable diapers for now. Pampers appear to be the best as far as ease of use at 3AM and lowest amount of blow outs. Our hospital used them as well.

### [Munchery](https://www.munchery.com)

Delivery++. For us, this has meant we've eaten better than take out food when we've been fried and in-between friend and family food drops.

### [Blue Apron](http://www.blueapron.com)

Pre-built meals, delivered once/week as component parts. Takes about 45 minutes to prepare the recipie. Advantage is it's cheaper than Munchery, easier than doing your own shopping, is tasty and healthy. Heads off takeout, plus the menus are pretty broad so you make stuff you might normally not cook. Better once you've started to get your feet underneath you (week 3-5); until then, Munchery and family food is the way to go.

## Things I wish I knew.

### Babies make a lot of noises that sound like they are dying.

They aren't dying. They are fine. They just sound like they are choking, or breathing hard, or not breathing, or having a heart attack, or being attacked by space goblins. They will make these noises when sleeping and when awake.

### The not sleeping starts before the baby is born.

Pregnancy is uncomfortable. There will be lots of trips to the bathroom and interrupted sleep. This will come as a surprise, and means that you'll be starting the infant care process already in sleep debt. Say goodbye to hippocampus function and nap as much as you can.
